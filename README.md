This project is an SMS Spam Detection system that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques to classify messages as spam or not spam. The project is implemented using Python and provides a user-friendly interface through a Streamlit web application.

## Overview

Spam messages can be a nuisance and even pose security risks. This project aims to build an effective spam detection system using a Naive Bayes classifier. By leveraging the power of NLP, the system can analyze and classify SMS messages, helping users to filter out unwanted spam.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing:** Cleans and preprocesses the SMS text data, including tokenization, removing stop words, and converting text to lowercase.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Uses a Naive Bayes classifier to detect whether a message is spam or not.
- **Streamlit Web Application:** A user-friendly interface for classifying messages in real-time.
- **Data Visualization:** Provides insights into the dataset through visualizations.
- **Model Persistence:** Saves the trained model and vectorizer for future use without retraining.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** 
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `nltk` for natural language processing
  - `scikit-learn` for building and evaluating the machine learning model
  - `Streamlit` for creating the web application
- **Machine Learning Model:** Multinomial Naive Bayes
- **Natural Language Processing:** TF-IDF Vectorizer
