[View SMS Spam Detection](https://smsemailspamclassifier-92d9wf4ns5ufhqflappjxvr.streamlit.app/)

This project is an SMS Spam Detection system that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques to classify messages as spam or not spam. The project is implemented using Python and provides a user-friendly interface through a Streamlit web application.

## Project Overview

This project involves:

- Cleaning and preprocessing the SMS data.
- Building a Naive Bayes classifier to detect spam messages.
- Visualizing data insights and model performance.
- Creating a Streamlit web application for real-time message classification.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **SMS Spam Collection** dataset. It consists of a collection of 5,574 SMS messages that have been classified as either 'ham' (legitimate) or 'spam'. The dataset can be found at the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection).

### Dataset Details

- **Columns:**
  - `label`: Indicates if the message is 'ham' or 'spam'.
  - `message`: The content of the SMS message.

- **Size:** 5,574 messages
